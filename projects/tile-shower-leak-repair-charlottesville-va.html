My investigation revealed that an active leak had deteriorated the OSB subfloor, though the underlying house floor joists remained solid.</p>

              <p class="project-copy"><strong>Repair:</strong> After installing a new subfloor and setting a Schluter foam shower pan, a Kerdi waterproofing membrane was applied over the pan and the lower wall sections where the original 12x12 tiles were removed. Once the membrane cured, new mosaic tile was installed across the entire shower floor and continued up the walls to replace the removed sections.</p>
